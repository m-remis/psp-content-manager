This is just simple application built using Electron, with minimal dependencies to keep it lightweight and straightforward. It leverages core Electron modules and a small set of production libraries, focusing on essential functionality without additional frameworks.

#### UI:
The interface is designed with basic HTML and CSS for simplicity and ease of customization. This approach minimizes the app's size and dependencies, ensuring faster load times and a clean, accessible design.

#### Backend:
The applicationâ€™s backend logic is implemented in TypeScript, providing type safety and clarity for handling filesystem interactions, folder navigation, and file extraction operations.
